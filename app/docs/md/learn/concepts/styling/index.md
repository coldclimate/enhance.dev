Since Enhance is standards based you are free to style however you like. You can add a stylesheet to the public folder and start cowboying styles like an absolute badass or bring whatever tooling you like. As long as your CSS tooling can output a static CSS file to the public folder of your app will be good to go.

## Plain old CSS like we used to do, but better

Modern CSS is pretty damn good nowadays. Most things you used to have to drag in a build pipeline for are now part of the Web Platform. It's pretty amazing really.
Enhance outputs an HTML page so you can add `<style>` or `<link>` tags to the [`head`](/docs/learn/starter-project/head) and start writing CSS right away.

## Tailwind

You can add whatever CSS tooling you are used to. Just configure it to output a CSS file to the public folder then reference it in your [`head`](/docs/learn/starter-project/head).

## Enhance styles

Enhance is a "batteries included" full-stack framework so we've preconfigured a styling system that is the culmination of decades of CSS research and development into a "best of all worlds" approach to styling. It isn't what all the cool kids are using... yet, but we feel that if you give it a chance the benefits of our **deep** styling experience will become apparent.
